# PyBer Analysis
Module 5 - MatPlotLib

## Overview

In this challenge, ridesharing data is used to create two infographics. The first is a summary table of drivers, rides, and fares separated into rural, suburban, and urban city settings. The second is a line graph of weekly fares, also separated by city type. This is accomplished with Pandas database tools and the python addon Matplotlib.PyPlot, a plotting library designed to work similarly to Matlab. 

## Results

In the summary table below, we see that while the majority of fares are in Urban areas, the number of drivers is oversaturated compared to less populated areas. This, in combination with a lower average fare per ride, leads to each driver making significantly less than their more rural counterparts. A factor one could glean from this table is the distance of a ride, which could lead to much higher fares in more spread out areas.

The line graph below reaffirms how much more fare is collected in the populated areas. Each city type stays roughly within consistent bounds over the months, though we can see some weeks where fares across the board surged or struggled regardless.

## Summary

For rural and suburban areas to compete, they must have more drivers available. So few drivers with vast distances to cover may be leaving money on the table. While this may impact the overall income of the current drivers, they currently make significantly more fare than their fellow drivers in cities. It could also be effective to promote more long-distance travel, so clients intending to leave urban areas can offer significant fares while also opening the local urban drivers the chance to have a rider on the trip back into the city. Lastly, while revenue in cities and suburbs is not lacking, the fare for a ride could be increased to better compensate the more congested driving conditions and improve the average fare price closer to the rural areas.
