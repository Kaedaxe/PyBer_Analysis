Module 5 - MatPlotLib

## Analysis

In this challenge, ridesharing data is used to create two infographics. The first is a summary table of drivers, rides, and fares separated into rural, suburban, and city settings. The second is a line graph of weekly fares, also separated by city type. This is accomplished with Pandas database tools and the python addon Matplotlib.PyPlot, a plotting library designed to work similarly to Matlab.
